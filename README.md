# Hi there 👋, I'm Thomas Gagnieu 

I'm a final-year **bioinformatics student** from France, currently exploring opportunities in research and data analysis.  
I specialize in **single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)** and **single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq)** data analysis, applied to **neurology**, **oncology**, and **myology**.  
I’m passionate about tackling complex biological questions using **computational methods**, **machine learning**, and **data-driven approaches**.  

Beyond bioinformatics, I have a deep interest in **astrophysics**, **science in general**, **rock music** (yes I'm a metalhead), **tennis**, and **traveling** in Asia.

## the key projects
In this github page, you will find the main projects in which I had the opportunity to participate. Projects oriented towards: 

### RNA-seq Analysis Tools
I have developed tools for **prediction**, **simulation**, **machine learning**, and **automated RNA-seq analysis pipelines**.  
These tools aim to simplify and accelerate the analysis of complex biological datasets, particularly in **neurology**, **oncology**, and **myology**.

### Bioinformatics Research
I work on several datasets to uncover biological insights at differents level (genomic, transcritomic or proteomic).  
My work includes **data preprocessing**, **integration**, **dimensionality reduction**, **clustering**, and **visualization**, using Python and R-based frameworks.

## ⚡ Fun Fact
🇫🇷 Yeah, I’m French, I love wine, cheese, bread, but I’m going to disappoint you, I don’t eat snails or frog legs!
